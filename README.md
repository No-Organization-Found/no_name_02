# Docsy Example

## Using the Docsy Example Project as a template

A simple way to get started is to use this project as a template, which gives you a site project that is set up and ready to use. To do this: 

1. Click **Use this template**.

2. Select a name for your new project and click **Create repository from template**.

3. Make your own local working copy of your new repo using git clone, replacing https://github.com/No-Organization-Found/no_name_02.git with your repo’s web URL:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/No-Organization-Found/no_name_02.git
```

You can now edit your own versions of the site’s source files.

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS`

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
